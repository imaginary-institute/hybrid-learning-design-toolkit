# Presence Lens

## Overview
Understanding "presence" is fundamental to effective hybrid facilitation, yet it's often the most misunderstood aspect of hybrid learning. The Hybrid Learning Presence Lens provides research-based frameworks for diagnosing presence gaps and targeted solutions for building teaching, social, and cognitive presence across physical and virtual spaces.

> **Tip:** Use this when you need to diagnose presence breakdowns or understand why something doesn't feel quite right in your hybrid sessions.

## Purpose
The Presence Lens serves as the theoretical foundation for all Dimension 3 tools, enabling facilitators to:

- Understand the three essential types of presence in hybrid learning
- Diagnose which presence is breaking down when problems arise
- Apply targeted solutions based on specific presence gaps
- Balance individual student needs with community presence requirements
- Establish shared agreements about presence and participation
- Move beyond surface-level "engagement" to meaningful presence

## How It Works

The tool presents presence as three interconnected dimensions: **Teaching Presence** (can students access guidance equally?), **Social Presence** (can students connect across spaces?), and **Cognitive Presence** (can students think together?). Each presence type manifests differently across physical spaces, digital platforms, and remote contexts, creating a matrix of intentional design requirements.

The diagnostic component helps identify which presence is breaking down by connecting observable symptoms to underlying presence gaps. Warning signs like "tech confusion" indicate teaching presence issues, while "students don't know names" signals social presence problems. The tool provides targeted card recommendations for each diagnosis.

## Connection to Other Tools

The Presence Lens works as the foundational framework that informs all other facilitation tools:

- **Before using Interaction Strategy Cards**: Diagnose which presence needs attention
- **Before using Community Building Cards**: Understand social presence requirements  
- **Before using Group Formation Guide**: Consider presence implications of group structures
- **When troubleshooting**: Return to presence diagnosis to identify root causes
