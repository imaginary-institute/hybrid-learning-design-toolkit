## Overview
Forming effective groups in hybrid learning environments requires intentional strategies that account for the unique challenges of mixed-modality collaboration. The Group Formation Guide provides decision frameworks, proven protocols, and troubleshooting strategies for creating teams that work across physical and virtual boundaries.

Whether you're organizing brief collaborative activities, semester-long project teams, or anything in between, this guide helps you navigate the complex considerations of group formation when students are distributed across different learning spaces.

## Purpose
The Group Formation Guide addresses one of the most common sources of inequity in hybrid learning: poorly formed groups that inadvertently isolate remote students or create unbalanced collaboration experiences. This tool helps you:

- **Make strategic decisions** about group composition based on activity type and duration
- **Implement proven protocols** for mixed-modality, parallel, or flexible group configurations  
- **Prevent common pitfalls** that lead to remote student isolation or uneven participation
- **Troubleshoot group dynamics** when collaboration isn't working effectively
- **Scale approaches** from quick pair activities to semester-long project teams
