# Participant Guide


## Overview
Students in hybrid environments often feel like passive recipients of whatever technology allows. The Participant Guide flips this dynamic, empowering learners to exercise agency in their hybrid learning experience by understanding their choices, customizing their participation, and advocating for their needs without requiring disclosure or justification.

## Purpose
The Participant Guide empowers student success by:

- Framing participation choices as rights rather than accommodations
- Providing self-assessment tools for identifying preferences and needs
- Offering flexible participation strategies for different contexts
- Including self-advocacy scripts and communication strategies
- Sharing technical customization tips for personalizing experiences
- Building inclusive learning communities through peer support
- Normalizing diverse engagement modes and preferences
