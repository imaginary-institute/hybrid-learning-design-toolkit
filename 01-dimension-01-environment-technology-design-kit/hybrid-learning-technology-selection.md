## Overview
Choosing technology for hybrid learning often starts backwards—with available tools rather than pedagogical needs. The Technology Selection Guide reframes this process around three fundamental questions: What do participants need to see? What do they need to hear? How do they need to participate? This need-based approach ensures technology serves learning rather than constraining it.

> **Tip:** Use this before investing in new technology—it guides strategic selection based on teaching needs rather than marketing promises.

## Purpose
The Technology Selection Guide helps educators make informed choices by:

- Starting with pedagogical needs rather than technology features
- Organizing selection criteria by visibility, audibility, and participation requirements
- Highlighting red flags for exclusionary technology choices
- Considering learner variability in every technology decision
- Matching technology sophistication to institutional readiness
- Building flexible technology ecosystems rather than isolated tools
