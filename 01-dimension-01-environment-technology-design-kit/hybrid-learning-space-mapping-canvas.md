## Overview
The Hybrid Learning Space Mapping Canvas is a comprehensive planning template that helps educators visualize and analyze their hybrid learning environment across three interconnected contexts: **Physical Classroom**, **Digital Environment**, and **Remote Students' Contexts**. This tool provides structured spaces for mapping concrete elements and analyzing how different forms of presence manifest across all learning spaces.

> **Tip:** This tool generates a printable worksheet for sketching and writing areas for analysis. Export as PDF or PNG to use during planning sessions or keep as reference during teaching.

## Purpose
This canvas serves as a foundational design tool that enables educators to:

- **Map concrete elements** across all the "three learning spaces" with dedicated sketching areas
- **Analyze presence types** (Teaching, Social, Cognitive) across physical and digital boundaries  
- **Identify integration opportunities** between in-person and remote learning experiences
- **Plan holistically** by considering what you control, what tools you'll use, and what resources learners bring
- **Export and use** as a physical planning worksheet during design and implementation
