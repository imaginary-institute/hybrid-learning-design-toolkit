# Hybrid Learning and Teaching Self-Assessment Kit: Complete Documentation

## Introduction and Purpose

The **Hybrid Learning and Teaching Self-Assessment Kit** is a comprehensive self-assessment toolkit designed to help educators evaluate their readiness for hybrid teaching across three essential dimensions, determine appropriate implementation levels based on capability and context, and create personalized development pathways. This toolkit responds to the documented challenges of hybrid teaching environments by providing structured reflection, capability assessment, and evidence-based implementation guidance.

The Self-Assessment Kit serves as one of the Integration and Support Tools within the broader Hybrid Learning Design Toolkit, enabling educators to:

- Reflect deeply on current hybrid teaching practices
- Identify capability levels across key dimensions
- Consider institutional context and support
- Create a visual representation of readiness
- Match capabilities to appropriate implementation levels
- Develop strategic approaches to hybrid teaching

Unlike traditional evaluation tools, the **Hybrid Teaching Compass** (the central component of this kit) takes a developmental approach, recognizing that educators progress through identifiable stages in their hybrid teaching journey and require different types of support at each phase.

## Position Within the Hybrid Learning Design Toolkit

The Hybrid Learning and Teaching Self-Assessment Kit is one of the Integration and Support Tools within the Hybrid Learning Design Toolkit. It serves as an entry point that helps educators:

- Determine appropriate implementation levels across the three toolkit dimensions
- Identify which toolkit components to prioritize based on current capabilities
- Create development pathways aligned with the toolkit's resources
- Connect assessment results to specific tools within each dimension:
  - Technology Mapping Matrix (Dimension 1)
  - Learning Experience Design Kit (Dimension 2)
  - Hybrid Interaction Management Kit (Dimension 3)

## Research Foundation

The Hybrid Learning and Teaching Self-Assessment Kit is grounded in multiple theoretical frameworks and empirical research on hybrid learning environments. The three-dimensional structure draws from the **Community of Inquiry** model (Garrison et al., 2000), the **TPACK framework** (Mishra & Koehler, 2006), and research by Bower et al. (2015, 2017) on synchronous hybrid learning. The capability levels are informed by developmental models including the **SAMR Model** (Puentedura, 2006), the **RAT Framework** (Hughes et al., 2006), and the **Stages of Technology Adoption** (Christensen & Knezek, 1999).

Recent empirical studies significantly influence the toolkit's approach. Research by Wagner et al. (2023) informs the emphasis on audio quality and engagement disparities, while studies by Handayani & Sulastri (2022) highlight the importance of teacher resilience and cognitive load management. Fabian et al. (2024) documentation of post-pandemic hybrid learning establishes the importance of an integrated approach across technological, pedagogical, and social domains.

The readiness profiles and implementation recommendations emerge from a synthesis of this research, addressing documented challenges while creating sustainable pathways for development that respect institutional context and teacher wellbeing.

I implement few specific strategies for community building across modalities. I find it challenging to monitor and respond to the engagement of all students simultaneously. I have limited approaches for supporting student agency in hybrid contexts.

**2 - DEVELOPING (Essential Implementation Zone)**
I implement basic inclusion strategies to acknowledge all participants. I use simple rotation of attention between student groups but sometimes overlook remote participants. I create structured participation opportunities but may not consistently balance engagement across modes. I implement introductory community-building activities but struggle to maintain connection throughout the course. I provide basic guidance for student participation choices.

**3 - FUNCTIONAL (Enhanced Implementation Zone)**
I create engaging experiences for both participation modes with intentional facilitation strategies. I implement effective protocols for balancing attention and participation across student groups. I monitor and manage engagement patterns to ensure relative equity. I facilitate meaningful cross-modal interaction between students in different locations. I address belonging and inclusion challenges with specific approaches.

**4 - PROFICIENT (Enhanced Implementation Zone)**
I design sophisticated approaches to engagement that foster strong connections across modalities. I implement strategic techniques to create parallel participation opportunities across locations. I facilitate multiple participation channels with effective monitoring systems. I develop ongoing community-building activities that transcend physical separation. I provide frameworks that support informed student choice and agency.

**5 - ADVANCED (Transformative Implementation Zone)**
I pioneer innovative engagement approaches that fully integrate physical and virtual spaces into a unified learning environment. My facilitation appears seamless across modes with dynamic techniques that respond to emerging needs. I develop deep community that transcends location limitations, creating genuine connection regardless of participation mode. I implement fluid boundary-crossing interaction patterns where modality becomes increasingly irrelevant to participation quality.

## Institutional Context Assessment
