# Hybrid Learning and Teaching Self-Assessment

## Overview

Effective hybrid teaching requires awareness of one's level of experience across multiple dimensions. The Hybrid Learning and Teaching Self-Assessment Tool (also called the "Hybrid Learning Teaching Compass") provides a comprehensive framework for educators to evaluate their readiness across the three essential dimensions of hybrid teaching, creating a visual representation of current experience level and targeted growth areas.
