# Getting Started: Orientation & Support Tools

Where should you start? What can you do immediately while planning deeper changes?
The Orientation & Support Tools function as your navigation system, helping you assess where you are, decide where to go, and take confident first steps without overwhelming transformation.

Building on change management theory, technology adoption frameworks, stages of concern and adult learning principles, these tools recognize that sustainable progress comes from meeting educators where they are and providing clear pathways forward. Rather than prescribing a single path, they honor diverse contexts, readiness levels, and entry points into hybrid teaching.

## How These Tools Work Together

These tools form a coordinated navigation system for your hybrid learning development journey. Rather than working in isolation, they connect to create a comprehensive approach to strategic planning and sustainable progress:


{: .note }
>#### Key Connections
>- **Self-Assessment → Decision Tree**: Comprehensive assessment informs strategic entry point decisions
>- **Decision Tree → Implementation Cards**: Entry point recommendations connect to appropriate implementation level
>- **Implementation Cards → Quick Wins**: Understanding your level guides which quick wins to implement first
>- **All Tools → Dimension Toolkits**: Everything connects to help you start with confidence in your chosen dimension

## Where to start

This orientation toolkit offers two main pathways depending on your available time and development approach. Whether you want comprehensive assessment and planning or need immediate guidance for urgent challenges, these tools can be combined strategically. Below are recommended **workflows for different scenarios** to help you navigate your hybrid learning journey effectively.

{: .note }
>### **<i class="fas fa-bullseye"></i> Comprehensive Assessment Path** (when you have time for strategic planning)
>1. **Self-Assessment Tool** - Complete comprehensive evaluation to map current readiness and identify growth areas
>2. **Decision Tree** - Use strategic navigation to find optimal starting dimension based on assessment results
>3. **Implementation Level Cards** - Set realistic progression goals using Essential → Enhanced → Transformative framework
>4. **Quick Wins** - Start implementing immediately while planning deeper changes
>5. **Dimension-Specific Toolkits** - Access targeted tools based on Decision Tree recommendations and assessment insights

{: .note }
>### **<i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Quick Start Path** (when you need immediate guidance)
>1. **Use Decision Tree** - Quickly identify urgent needs and recommended entry point
>2. **Note Your Recommended Dimension** - Understand which toolkit will best address your challenges
>3. **Review Relevant Implementation Cards** - Set realistic expectations for your context
>4. **Implement Universal Quick Wins** - Start with strategies that work in any context immediately
>5. **Add Dimension-Specific Quick Wins** - Layer in targeted actions based on your identified path

{: .note }
>### **<i class="fas fa-sync-alt"></i> Ongoing Development Path** (for iterative improvement)
>1. **Revisit Self-Assessment** - Regularly update your readiness profile as you grow
>2. **Expand Implementation Levels** - Use Implementation Cards to guide progression to next level
>3. **Cross-Dimension Integration** - Use Decision Tree to identify connections between dimensions
>4. **Continuous Quick Wins** - Maintain momentum with ongoing immediate improvements

## Research Foundation

This orientation approach is grounded in a critical insight from change management research: attempting to transform all aspects of teaching simultaneously leads to cognitive overload and implementation failure. Educators need clear entry points, self-awareness of their capabilities, appropriate expectations, and immediate actions that build confidence while planning larger changes.

Our approach integrates change management theory through creating urgency via quick wins (Kotter's 8-Step Process), building awareness, desire, knowledge, ability, and reinforcement (ADKAR Model), and meeting educators where they are in their development journey (Stages of Concern framework). This ensures sustainable progress rather than overwhelming transformation.

Technology adoption frameworks inform our implementation levels, building upon the same progressive models used throughout the toolkit while incorporating emotional readiness through stages of technology adoption. Adult learning principles emphasize educator agency in choosing their own developmental path through self-directed learning and matching challenges to current readiness levels.

The tools recognize that context varies dramatically, multiple entry points exist, incremental progress works, and reflection drives growth. Rather than prescribing a single path, they honor educator expertise and diverse institutional contexts while providing structured guidance for confident next steps.
