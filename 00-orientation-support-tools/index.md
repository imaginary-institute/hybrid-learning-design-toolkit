# Getting Started: Orientation & Support Tools

Where should you start? What can you do immediately while planning deeper changes?
The Orientation & Support Tools function as your navigation system, helping you assess where you are, decide where to go, and take confident first steps without overwhelming transformation.

Building on change management theory, technology adoption frameworks, stages of concern and adult learning principles, these tools recognize that sustainable progress comes from meeting educators where they are and providing clear pathways forward. Rather than prescribing a single path, they honor diverse contexts, readiness levels, and entry points into hybrid teaching.

# Start Here: Quick Guide to the Toolkit

## What Challenge Are You Facing Right Now?

### ðŸ”´ "I'm teaching hybrid tomorrow and need immediate help"
**Your path:** Quick fixes and in-session support
- Start with [Hybrid Teaching: Quick Fixes](/01-dimension-01-environment-technology-design-kit/hybrid-learning-environment-quick-response-guide) - 60-second readiness checks
- Grab [Facilitation Strategy Cards](/03-dimension-03-facilitation-equity-community-design-kit/hybrid-learning-facilitation-strategy-cards) - manage attention across spaces
- Bookmark [Making Hybrid Work for Everyone](/03-dimension-03-facilitation-equity-community-design-kit/making-hybrid-work-for-everyone) - handle access issues as they arise

**Time needed:** 10 minutes to review, use during class

---

### ðŸŸ¡ "I have a few days to improve my hybrid sessions"
**Your path:** Design better activities and engagement
- Map your environment with [Space Mapping Canvas](/01-dimension-01-environment-technology-design-kit/hybrid-learning-space-mapping-canvas) - understand your three spaces
- Browse [Activity Cards](/02-dimension-02-learning-experience-assessment-kit/hybrid-learning-activity-cards) - find 2-3 activities that fit your content
- Add [Community Building Cards](/03-dimension-03-facilitation-equity-community-design-kit/hybrid-learning-community-building-cards) - pick one icebreaker and one closing activity

**Time needed:** 1-2 hours planning

---

### ðŸŸ¢ "I'm redesigning my course for hybrid delivery"
**Your path:** Systematic course transformation
1. Take the [Self-Assessment](/00-orientation-support-tools/hybrid-learning-self-assessment) - identify your readiness level
2. Review [Implementation Levels](/00-orientation-support-tools/hybrid-learning-implementation-level-cards) - understand the progression
3. Design with [Activity Sequence Canvas](/02-dimension-02-learning-experience-assessment-kit/hybrid-activity-sequence-canvas) and [Activity Cards](/02-dimension-02-learning-experience-assessment-kit/hybrid-learning-activity-cards) - plan full sessions
4. Integrate [Assessment Method Cards](/02-dimension-02-learning-experience-assessment-kit/hybrid-learning-assessment-cards) - align evaluation

**Time needed:** 4-6 hours initial design, ongoing refinement

## The Toolkit at a Glance

**Three Dimensions, One Goal:** Effective hybrid learning that works for everyone

| Dimension | Focus | Start With |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| [1: Environment & Technology](/01-dimension-01-environment-technology-design-kit/) | Can everyone see, hear, participate? | Space Mapping Canvas |
| [2: Learning Experience](/02-dimension-02-learning-experience-assessment-kit/) | Are activities engaging everyone? | Activity Strategy Cards |
| [3: Facilitation & Community](/03-dimension-03-facilitation-equity-community-design-kit/) | Is anyone feeling left out? | Facilitation Strategy Cards |
