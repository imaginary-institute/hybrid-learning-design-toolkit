# Implementation Level Cards



## Overview
The Implementation Levels Cards helps you understand the three levels of hybrid teaching sophistication available across all dimensions of the Hybrid Learning Design Toolkit. Rather than prescribing a single "correct" approach, these levels acknowledge that effective hybrid teaching can happen at different depths of implementation based on your context, experience, and available resources.
