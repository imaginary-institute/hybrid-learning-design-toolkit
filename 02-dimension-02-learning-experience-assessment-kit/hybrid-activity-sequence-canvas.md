# Activity Sequence Canvas



## Overview
Effective hybrid learning requires systematic sequencing of activities that engage students across participation modes while maintaining pedagogical coherence. The Hybrid Learning Activity Sequence Canvas provides a large-format visual planning framework for organizing learning segments with intentional engagement progression, ensuring all students have equivalent opportunities to participate and contribute regardless of their location.

## Purpose
The Activity Sequence Canvas serves as the central planning tool for Dimension 2, enabling educators to:

- Design learning sequences that balance cognitive engagement levels (receiving, responding, creating)
- Plan smooth transitions between activities that work across modalities
- Align assessment strategies with learning activities and engagement goals
- Map technology requirements and modality adaptations for each segment
- Ensure equitable participation opportunities for on-site and remote students
- Create coherent learning narratives that span session, module, or course timeframes
- Visualize cognitive load distribution and participation patterns
