## Overview
Not every learning activity translates seamlessly to hybrid environments. The Learning Activity Adapter provides systematic analysis tools for redesigning activities to work equitably across participation modes. Whether you're retrofitting existing content or designing new hybrid-specific activities, this tool ensures learning experiences are equivalent (not identical) for all students regardless of location.

## Purpose
The Learning Activity Adapter serves as a systematic design analysis tool, enabling educators to:

- Redesign learning activities to work equitably across participation modes
- Map side-by-side experiences for on-site versus remote participants
- Identify and address cognitive load differences before implementation
- Analyze accessibility requirements for diverse student contexts
- Create specific adaptation strategies for participation barriers
- Troubleshoot existing activities that aren't working well for remote students
- Design assessment approaches that maintain validity across modalities
