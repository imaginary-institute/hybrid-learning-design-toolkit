# Dimension 2: Learning Experience & Assessment Design Kit

How do we create activities and assessments that engage all students equally, whether they're in the classroom or joining from across the world?
This dimension addresses the pedagogical redesign necessary for effective hybrid teaching.

Drawing on multiple instructional design traditions, learning design methodologies, and empirical hybrid research (including Laurillard's six learning types, ABC Learning Design rapid prototyping, ICAP cognitive engagement framework, and studies documenting engagement disparities), these tools support systematic activity design that ensures equivalent opportunities regardless of location.

## How These Tools Work Together

These tools form a coordinated system for designing learning activities and assessments that work equitably across modalities. Rather than working in isolation, they connect to create a comprehensive approach to hybrid learning experience design:

{: .note }
>#### Key Connections
>- **Canvas → Activity Cards**: Your sequence planning directly informs which activity types work best in each segment
>- **Activity Cards → Assessment Cards**: Activity engagement levels guide appropriate assessment method selection
>- **All Tools → Design Across Spaces Companion**: Use alongside any tool for guidance on designing across three spaces
>- **Activity Adapter → All Tools**: Systematic equity analysis can be applied to any tool's outputs

## Where to start

This dimension offers multiple entry points depending on your context and needs. Whether you're planning a new course, redesigning existing activities, or responding to immediate assessment challenges, the tools can be combined strategically. Below are recommended **workflows for different scenarios** to help you navigate these resources effectively.

>4. **Update assessment approaches** using Assessment Method Cards aligned to new engagement levels

## Research Foundation

This dimension emerges from a critical insight in hybrid learning research: even perfect technology fails without intentional pedagogical redesign. Post-pandemic studies reveal that simply streaming traditional classroom activities online creates what Wagner et al. (2023) call "second-class" experiences for remote students, with consistently lower engagement and participation rates.

The breakthrough comes from understanding that effective hybrid learning requires "equivalency" rather than identical experiences—equivalent opportunities for engagement, learning, and demonstration of knowledge across modalities. This insight reshapes everything from activity selection to assessment design.

Our approach synthesizes multiple instructional design traditions into practical tools. The ICAP framework (Chi & Wylie, 2014) provides the engagement progression that structures all planning: moving systematically from Receiving (passive) through Responding (active) to Creating (constructive) engagement. This isn't just theoretical—research consistently shows that remote students benefit disproportionately from higher engagement levels.

The toolkit operationalizes multiple design methodologies and frameworks — all adapted specifically for hybrid contexts and through the lenses of User Experience design common practices. Drawing from both established methodologies and emerging hybrid learning research, these tools help create learning experiences that leverage the unique affordances of hybrid environments while ensuring equitable participation opportunities. The tools enable instructors to design purposeful learning sequences that maintain engagement and effectiveness across physical and virtual spaces.
