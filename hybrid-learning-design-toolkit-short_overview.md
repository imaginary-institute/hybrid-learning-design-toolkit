# Hybrid Learning Design Toolkit Overview

## What This Is
The Hybrid Learning Design Toolkit is a **research-informed design project** created by learning experience designers to support educators in developing effective hybrid learning experiences. Is a **conceptual synthesis** that translates research findings into a collection of **practical and actionable** learning design **tools**.


## What's in the Toolkit?

A toolkit, at its core, is a **curated collection** of interconnected yet **modular tools** that work both independently and in combination. Like a craftsperson's toolbox, each instrument serves a **specific purpose** while contributing to a larger creative process. In the context of learning design, our toolkit provides both **interactive and static resources** that educators can select based on their immediate needs or combine for comprehensive course transformation.

This **modular approach** reflects how educators actually work—sometimes you need a **quick solution** for tomorrow's class, other times you're planning an **entire course redesign**. The tools connect through **shared frameworks** and visual language, but each **stands alone** as a useful resource. You might start with a single facilitation strategy card during a challenging session, then later discover how it connects to the activity sequence canvas for systematic planning.
 

## Who Is This For?

This toolkit is designed for **educators and learning designers** who are actively teaching or designing hybrid learning experiences. Whether you're an **individual instructor** adapting your courses, a **learning designer** supporting faculty, or part of a **teaching team** exploring hybrid approaches, the tools provide practical resources for immediate implementation. **No prior expertise** in hybrid teaching is required—the implementation levels **meet you where you are**.

The toolkit works across **all disciplines and subject areas**—from laboratory sciences to discussion-based seminars, from skills-based training to theoretical explorations. It's equally relevant whether you teach **mathematics, literature, engineering, arts, or professional practice** courses.

The **full theoretical background**, **detailed literature review**, and **complete bibliography** are available in the comprehensive toolkit overview document, providing transparency about the research base while maintaining the toolkit's focus on practical application.
